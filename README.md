## Data-Incubator-Project

The Chesapeake Monitoring Cooperative (CMC) is a group of leading organizations that provide technical, programmatic, and outreach support in order to integrate volunteer-based and non-traditional water quality and macroinvertebrate monitoring data into the Chesapeake Bay Program partnership. Currently there are many sources of data, including data collected by volunteers, local governments and NGOs, that are not being used to track Bay health.

My plan for this project is to use the large scale of original data gathered by volunteers to find how to deal with missing values, make more complete time-series graphs, and explore the potential connection between variables for the purpose of inference and prediction. Then we can use the predicted data to verify the actual water quality, which will be helpful to detect the abnormal changes of water quality in time and guide our further actions.
